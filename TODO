KNOWN BUGS:

* Advi is unsafe!
==> Put an option -safe that will not launch any applets
                  -safe=ask should open a dialog and allow

        This one?  yes/no
        Other applets of this file? yes/no


LIMITATIONS:

* PStricks ne marche pas correctement avec \ncarc etc. (annotation sur les
  flèches). 

* font searches uses the hard-wired directory "/usr/share/texmf/ls-R" (in 
config.ml.in instead of dynamically finding the search path for fonts). 
This will not work if the user install news fonts and sets some environment
variable accordingly. 

CLEANING: 

* transbox: replace steps by a timer

* alpha, blend, etc. for images: keep track within text and emit the info
  at every image?

WISH LIST: 

 - Some option to stop effects would also be nice

    . wait are ignored

    . embeded applets are not launched
      (then, they could be launch by a key stroke, this is actually an
       interesting mode for applets)

    . reload would not kill/restart applets that are the same string command
      after reloading (this is also an interesting feature)

- Adapter la résolution aux vrai dpy de l'écran

- traiter directement les images gifs avec camlimage.

==> tester fullscreen mode

- fork? (i.e. lancer un dvi identique à celui qui tourne)

- améliorer advi.sty
 
  * pour les bulles-actives 
      -> générer un slide supplémentaire
      -> générer des footnotes (avec un cadre ou dans une mini-bulle)

  * exporter \ifadvi et \Ifadvi

  BUGS:

* Once, advi when looping... I could not find what was going on (I was not
able to reproduce). It was in a phase between clicking (on an active anchor)
reloading of the file and recording. 

* embedded applications are not killed when advi is killed.
==> Is this fixed?

* we must give some unique names to persistent apps without explicit names
==> If this done?
