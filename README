    advi -safer file.dvi

    Active-DVI ``plays'' the DVI files that is displays: during
    presentation advi can launch arbitrary commands that were
    incorporated into the LaTeX source of the DVI file to animate the
    presentation.
    Hence, when playing a DVI file from some untrusted source, you
    must use the -safer option that prevents the execution of
    embedded commands:

    advi -safer file.dvi

For instance, if you choose advi as your default application to view
DVI files, the safe entry for your .mailcap file is
 
    application/x-dvi; advi -safer %s

It is also recommended to check before visualisation the list of
embedded commands that a suspicious DVI file could execute by calling

    advi -n file.dvi


                 Presentation
                 ============


Active-DVI is a DVI previewer and presenter written in Objective Caml
(http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/) with some eye candy effects for
presentation, support for interactive demonstrations, and embedding of
arbitrary applications within the presentation (hence the Active
adjective of the presenter :).

Active-DVI is largely based on Mldvi written by Alexandre Miquel
(http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~miquel/).

Version: 1.8
available at http://advi.inria.fr/

CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FEATURES:
=============================

+ Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion (using graphics package)
+ Effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 
+ Embedded applications for interactive demonstration

+ Pictures visualization via gpic specials

+ Display of inlined Postscript using gs
+ Font antialiasing that takes background colors into account
+ Page display is interrupted on user input
+ Resizing the page adjusts the magnification
+ Start displaying at a given page or at a given link reference
+ The file is reloading on signal SIGUSR1
+ Hyperlinks
+ Active areas (execute an action when the mouse is over)
+ Background colors and images
+ Alpha blending for images

INVOCATION
==========

The invocation is

        advi [OPTIONS...] DVIFILE

where OPTIONS are:

  -safer                Safer mode: external applications are not launched
  -geometry GEOM        Sets the (maximum) geometry GEOM
  -g GEOM               Same as -geometry GEOM
  -crop                 Crop the window to the best size (default)
  -nocrop               Disable cropping
  -nomargins            Suppress horizontal and vertical margins
  -hmargin DIMEN        Horizontal margin  (default: 1cm)
  -vmargin DIMEN        Vertical margin    (default: 1cm)
  -A                    Set Postscript antialias
  -bg                   Draw in the background
  -fullwidth            Adjust size to width
  -html STRING          Make advi start at html reference of name STRING
  -nogs                 Turn off dipslay of inlined Postscript
  -nopauses             Swictch pauses off
  -page INT             Make advi start at page INT
  -pager STRING         Command to call the pager
  -safer                Safer mode: external applications are not launched
  -scalestep REAL       Scale step for '<' and '>' (default sqrt (sqrt (sqrt 2.0)))

Geometry GEOM is specified in pixels, using the standard format
for specifying geometries (i.e: "WIDTHxHEIGHT[+XOFFSET+YOFFSET]").

Dimensions (for options `-hmargin' and `-vmargin') are specified as
numbers optionally followed by two letters representing units.

When no units are given, dimensions are treated as numbers of pixels.

Currently supported units are the standard TeX units as specified in
the TeXbook (D. Knuth, Addison-Wesley, (C) 1986):

  `pt' (point), `pc' (pica), `in' (inch), `bp' (big point),
  `cm' (centimeter), `mm' (millimeter), `dd' (didot point),
  `cc' (cicero) and `sp' (scaled point).

Note that dimensions are specified w.r.t the original TeX document,
and do not correspond to what is actually shown on the screen, which
can be displayed at a different resolution than specified in the
original TeX source.


KEYSTROKES
==========

Advi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.
Each may optionally be preceded by a number, called ARG below, whose
interpretation is keystroke dependant. If ARG is unset, its value is
1, unless specified otherwise.

Advi maintains an history of previously visited pages organized as a stack. 
Additionnally, the history contains mark pages which are stronger than
unmarked pages.

q       Quits the program

return  If ARG is non zero, push the current page on the history stack,
        and move forward Arg physical pages.

n       Move ARG physical pages forward, leaving the history unchanged.

p       Move ARG physical pages backward, leaving the history unchanged.

tab     Push the current page on top of the history as a marked page,
        do no move.

space   Move to the next pause if any, or do as return otherwise.

backspace
        Move ARG pages backward according to the history.
        The history stack is poped, accordingly. 

escape
        Move ARG marked pages backward according to the history.
        Do nothing if the history does no contain any marked page.

g       If ARG is unset move to the last page.
        If ARG is the current page do nothing.
        Otherwise, push the current page on the history as a marked
        page, and move to the physical page ARG.

,       Move to the first page.
        
.       Move to the last page.
        
c       Center the page in the window, and resets the default resolution.
        
<       Scale the resolution by 1/1.414

>       Scale the resolution by 1.414

f       Load all the fonts used in the documents. By default, fonts
        are loaded only when needed.

r       Redraw the current page.

R       Reload the file and redraw the current page.

F       Does the same as `f', and precomputes the glyphs of all
        characters used in the document. This takes more time than
        loading the fonts, but the pages are drawn faster.

C       Erase the image cache.

A click on an hyperlink, push the current page on this history as marked
(unless the target page is the current page) and move to the target page.
If the target is visible, it highlights the target.

Moreover, the user can drag the currently displayed page in the window
in order to change its relative position. (This is useful when the
page is displayed at a resolution such that cannot fit in the
window.)


EYE CANDY MACROS
================

Using the LaTeX style advi.sty provided with the package, you can
embed some Active-DVI specials into your TeX documents. Advi
interprets those specials to provide some eye candy features for your
presentation.

\wait{sec}
	Delay the rendering at the point of the document for sec
        seconds. Wait forever (i.e. stops) if parameter sec is omitted.

\advirecord[play]{this}{material}
	Define an "advi tag" named ``this'' to refer to the text
        enclosed in the following brackets. The tag can be later on
        to play or replay the text. By default, [material] is not
        display, unless option [play] is set.

\adviplay[color]{this}
	Replay the material previously bound to {this}. If [color] is
        provided changes the drawing color to [color] before displaying.

Please look at doc/manula.dvi for more information.
Look in directory test for examples (try advi test/*.dvi).
Advanced examples are in directory examples.
