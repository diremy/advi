Active dvi is a DVI previewer and presenter written in Objective Caml
(http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/) with some eye candy effects for presentation.

Active dvi is largely based on Mldvi written by Alexandre Miquel
(http://pauillac.inria.fr/~miquel/).

Version: 0.5

INVOCATION
==========

The invocation is

        advi [OPTIONS...] DVIFILE

where OPTIONS are:

  -geometry GEOM        Sets the (maximum) geometry GEOM
  -g GEOM               Same as -geometry GEOM
  -crop                 Crop the window to the best size (default)
  -nocrop               Disable cropping
  -hmargin DIMEN        Horizontal margin  (default: 1cm)
  -vmargin DIMEN        Vertical margin    (default: 1cm)

  -A                    Set Postscript antialias
  -bg                   Draw in the background
  -fullwidth            Adjust size to width
  -html STRING          Make advi start at html reference of name STRING
  -nogs                 Turn off dipslay of inlined Postscript
  -nopauses             Swictch pauses off
  -page INT             Make advi start at page INT

Geometry GEOM is specified in pixels, using the standard format
for specifying geometries (i.e: "WIDTHxHEIGHT[+XOFFSET+YOFFSET]").

Dimensions (for options `-hmargin' and `-vmargin') are specified as
numbers optionally followed by two letters representing units.

When no units are given, dimensions are treated as numbers of pixels.

Currently supported units are the standard TeX units as specified in
the TeXbook (D. Knuth, Addison-Wesley, (C) 1986):

  `pt' (point), `pc' (pica), `in' (inch), `bp' (big point),
  `cm' (centimeter), `mm' (millimeter), `dd' (didot point),
  `cc' (cicero) and `sp' (scaled point).

Note that dimensions are specified w.r.t the original TeX document,
and do not correspond to what is actually shown on the screen, which
can be displayed at a different resolution than specified in the
original TeX source.


KEYSTROKES
==========

Advi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.
Each may optionally be preceded by a number, called ARG below, whose
interpretation is keystroke dependant. If ARG is unset, its value is
1, unless specified otherwise.

Advi maintains an history of previously visited pages organized as a stack. 
Additionnally, the history contains mark pages which are stronger than
unmarked pages.

q       Quits the program

return  If ARG is non zero, push the current page on the history stack,
        and move forward Arg physical pages.

n       Move ARG physical pages forward, leaving the history unchanged.

p       Move ARG physical pages backward, leaving the history unchanged.

tab     Push the current page on top of the history as a marked page,
        do no move.

space   Move to the next pause if any, or do as return otherwise.

backspace
        Move ARG pages backward according to the history.
        The history stack is poped, accordingly. 

escape
        Move ARG marked pages backward according to the history.
        Do nothing if the history does no contain any marked page.

g       If ARG is unset move to the last page.
        If ARG is the current page do nothing.
        Otherwise, push the current page on the history as a marked
        page, and move to the physical page ARG.

,       Move to the first page.
        
.       Move to the last page.
        
c       Center the page in the window, and resets the default resolution.
        
<       Scale the resolution by 1/1.414

>       Scale the resolution by 1.414

f       Load all the fonts used in the documents. By default, fonts
        are loaded only when needed.

r       Redraw the current page.

R       Reload the file and redraw the current page.

F       Does the same as `f', and precomputes the glyphs of all
        characters used in the document. This takes more time than
        loading the fonts, but the pages are drawn faster.

C       Erase the image cache.

A click on an hyperlink, push the current page on this history as marked
(unless the target page is the current page) and move to the target page.
If the target is visible, it highlights the target.

Moreover, the user can drag the currently displayed page in the window
in order to change its relative position. (This is useful when the
page is displayed at a resolution such that cannot fit in the
window.)


EYE CANDY MACROS
================

Using the LaTeX style advi.sty provided with the package, you can
embed some Active dvi specials into your TeX documents. Advi
interprets those specials to provide some eye candy features for your
presentation.

\pause
	Advi stops rendering at this point of the source document and 
	waits a user key stroke.

\wait{sec}
	Delay the rendering at the point of the document for sec seconds. 

\tag{this}{material}
	Define an "advi tag" named ``this'' to refer to the text
        enclosed in the following brackets. The tag can be used to
        change the color of the text later. 

\hide{this}{material}
	Same as \tag{this}{material}, but does not render the text at
        this point. You can display the text later, using the \play macro.

\play{this}
	Display the texts associated with the tag ``this''.

\hilight{this}{col}
	Display the texts associated with the tag ``this'', using the
        color ``col''.

Please look at test/demo.{tex|dvi} and test/macros.{tex|dvi} for
more information and examples.
