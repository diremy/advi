Active-DVI is a programmable presenter and previewer for texts or slides
written in LaTeX, hence the presentation tool of choice for the discriminating
hacker.

Version 1.8.0 is now available. It is mainly an update of the 1.7
version of Active-DVI that makes it compatible with camlimages version
3.1.0. 

The Active-DVI previewer features in addition to regular DVI previewers:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion
     (using the graphics LaTeX package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

   * Embedded applications

   * Support for backpointing to the source file.

   * Support for PStricks, PGF, and beamer.

   * Support for WhizzyTeX

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of the various talks in
the directory ``examples''.
