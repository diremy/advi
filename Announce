                       Active-DVI


Version 1.9.0 is now available. 

Active-DVI is a programmable presenter and previewer for texts or slides
written in LaTeX. 

It can display files in DVI format and is thus a possible replacement for
other DVI previewers. 

It also commes with a package advi.sty that provided new macros and generate
new DVI-specials understood by Active-DVI that enables:

   * Image file inclusions in a variety of different formats 

   * Some effects for presentation: pause, delay,  background images,
     transitions, etc.

   * Embedded applications.

   * Special Support for WhizzyTeX including

      - Backpointing to the source file. 
      - (Rudimentary) support for moving or resizing objects with the mouse.

This release is mostly for maintainance, with only a few new features:

   * Improved configuration.

   * Default previewing of embedded postscript images with ghostscript, 
     (usually faster than with camlimages).

   * Source files may be in gzip or bzip2 format.

This version of advi also supports the pgf package and the beamer document
class. 

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of the various talks in
the directory ``examples''.
