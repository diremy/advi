ADK 1.0.0

This is the adk, Advi Development Kit version 1.0.0.
It contains the source code of the Active-DVI version 1.0.0 and
the required libraries (camltk and camlimages).

* Manual installation

To compile Advi, you must make and install the libraries (camltk and 
camlimages) first, including their native code versions. After the
successful installation of the libraries, move to the directory advi-1.0.0 
and compile Advi itself.

* Automatic "brain-dead" installation

Or, You can just type "make" in this directory and hope everything goes
well. It automatically compiles and installs the libraries and advi...,
only if you are extreamly lucky. (RedHat and Mandrake users tend to be 
lucky, I guess... Otherwise you may encounter configuring troubles as usual.)

If you have installed some software to solve installation problems,
type "make reconfigure" to re-perform the configuration process.
