A library to retrieves and get usable X fonts.
==============================================

The script "compile_library" compiles and links the library fonts_table.cma
The script "compile" compiles and links the example program using the library, main.ml.

The example program just output the fonts it has found on your machine.

File xfonts.mli implements the Caml specification of X fonts.
File get_xfonts retrieves, loads and parses the entire list of X fonts on the current box.
File xfonts_table.ml adds a hash table mechanism to the basic get_xfonts stuff.
File fonts_table.ml further adds a memo mechanism to the basic xfonts_table
stuff, since calling the X server for fonts could be rather time consuming.

 man XSetWMProperties
(display, w, window_name, icon_name, argv, argc,
                             normal_hints, wm_hints, class_hints)
       XSetWMName, XGetWMName, XStoreName, XFetchName - set or read a window's
       WM_NAME property

The XSetWMIconName convenience function calls XSetTextProperty to set
the WM_ICON_NAME property.

       The XGetIconSizes function returns zero if a window manager has not set
       icon sizes; otherwise, it return nonzero.  XGetIconSizes should be
       called by an application that wants to find out what icon sizes would
       be most appreciated by the window manager under which the application
       is running.  The application should then use XSetWMHints to supply the
       window manager with an icon pixmap or window in one of the supported
       sizes.  To free the data allocated in size_list_return, use XFree.
