Active-DVI is a programmable presenter and previewer for texts or slides
written in LaTeX, hence the presentation tool of choice for the discriminating
hacker.

Version 1.8.0 is now available. It is mainly an update of the 1.7
version of Active-DVI that makes it compatible with camlimages version 3.1.0

This version has been developed by Jun Furuse, Didier Rémy and
Pierre Weis with also contributions by Roberto Di Cosmo.

In addition to the regular features of the Active-DVI previewer:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion
     (using the graphics LaTeX package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

   * Embedded applications

this release still features:

   * Some support for pgf and beamer

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of the various talks in
the directory ``examples''.

The source code and more information are available at

Once again, contributions and comments are warmly welcome.
