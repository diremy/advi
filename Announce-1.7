Active-DVI is a programmable presenter and previewer for texts or slides
written in LaTeX, hence the presentation tool of choice for the discriminating
hacker.

Version 1.7.0 is now available. It is mainly an update and bug fix of the 1.6
version of Active-DVI.

This version has been developed by Jun Furuse, Didier Rémy and
Pierre Weis with also contributions by Roberto Di Cosmo.

In addition to the regular features of the Active-DVI previewer:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion
     (using the graphics LaTeX package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

   * Embedded applications

this release still features:

   * Improved API for embedded applications.

   * Support for X colors via an additional xwindows-colors.sty LaTeX package.

   * Thumbnails to see the entire presentation at a glance (press T to
     build the thumbnails, then t to toggle from thumbnails to your
     presentation).

   * Hyper references can now be made invisible.

   * Enhanced background possibilities.

   * A laser pointer.

   * Support for ``scripting'' from within the LaTeX source file via
     key bindings events generation.

   * Programmable save-slide feature.

   * An additional advi-slides.sty package facilitates easy
     presentations and is specially devoted to the impatient and/or
     the beginner. (Comments on this new package are warmly welcome.)

   * Additional examples, including simple ones for the slitex LaTeX package.

   * An improved manual.

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of the various talks in
the directory ``examples''.
