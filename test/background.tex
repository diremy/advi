\subsection* {Active dvi supports background effects}

This file demonstrates a simple showcase for background effects.

\newpage

You can perform some simple background effects, that
allow to fix a background color and/or image in your slides.

For example, this page has a yellow background because we included
in the LaTeX source of the page the command:
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
	\setbgcolor{Yellow} 
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}
\setbgcolor{Yellow} 

\newpage

\setbgimage{world.jpg} 

But we can also set a background image, like \verb|world.jpg| which
is now in the test directory.

We included in this page the command

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
        \setbgimage{world.jpg} 
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}

\newpage

\subsection* {Inheriting page backgrounds}

By default, Advi will propagate to a page the background information
of the previous page (Warning: previous page means the page
\emph{previously displayed}, which is not necessarily the previous
page in the dvi file, as happens when you use \emph{jump} commands).

For example, this page has still the background image, even if no
command is included, because it inherits the background of the
previous page.

If you do not like this behaviour, and prefer to have only the
background explicitly declared in a page, run advi with the
\verb|--reset_bkgd| option.

%\setbgcolor{Red}

\newpage

Otherwise, you can locally issue a \verb|\resetbg| command, that 
\resetbg
resets the background eliminating everything which is inherited. This
is how we got rid of the background image in this page, that only
sports a nice Cyan background color.

\setbgcolor{Cyan}

Ah, of course, you can use the usual LaTeX colors (or define new ones
the usual way) for backgrounds.

Anybody willing to add support for color gradients?
