\subsection* {Modifying the page backround}

It is now possible to modify the background of your presentations, and
this file is a simple showcase for the current background effects:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item changing the color background,
    \item defining a background image,
    \item inheriting background settings,
    \item resetting background settings
  \end{itemize}
\newpage

\subsection* {Setting the background color}

This page has a yellow background because we included
in the LaTeX source of the page the following command:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
	\setbgcolor{Yellow} 
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}
\setbgcolor{Yellow} 

\newpage

\subsection* {Setting the background image}

\setbgimage{world.jpg} 

Wee can also set a background image, like \verb|world.jpg| which
is now in the test directory, by including in the page the command

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
        \setbgimage{world.jpg} 
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}

\parindent 0pt Note: the image formats supported depend on the variable
  \begin{quote}
CAMLIMAGESLIBS
  \end{quote}
in Advi's Makefile.config 
\newpage

\subsection* {Inheriting page backgrounds}

By default, Advi will propagate to a page the background information
of the previous page (Warning: previous page means the page
\emph{previously displayed}, which is not necessarily the previous
page in the dvi file, as happens when you use \emph{jump} commands).

For example, this page has still the background image, even if no
command is included, because it inherits the background of the
previous page.

\newpage

\subsection* {Resetting page backgrounds}

If you do not like the implicit inheritance of the background configuration, and you
want to see obeyed only the background directives explicitly declared in a page, you 
have two options:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item run advi with the \verb|--reset_bkgd| option: this way, background inheritance
          is disabled in all the file, or
    \item you can locally issue a \verb|\resetbg| command, that resets the background 
          eliminating everything which is inherited. This is how we got rid of
          the background image in this page, that only sports a nice Cyan background color.
  \end{itemize}

\resetbg

\setbgcolor{Cyan} 

Of course, you can use the usual LaTeX colors (or define new ones the usual way) for backgrounds.

\Newpage
\special{color push white}
\setbgcolor{black}
 \advifooter\adviheader

\subsection* {Reverse video effect}

If you want a reverse video effect, you just have to set the background
of the page to black and the text color to white, as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item set the background to black, anywhere in the text of the slide with

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
	\setbgcolor{Black} 
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}

\item set the text color to white using
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
	\special{color push white}
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}
at the beginning of the slide.

\end{itemize}

To revert to normal text color, use

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{verbatim}
	\special{color pop}
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{quote}

at the end of the slide. (Write \verb"\resetbg" at the
biginning of next slide, if you also want to revert to normal background.)

\special{color pop}

\newpage

\resetbg

\subsection* {TODO:}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item implement command options to \verb|\setbgimg| to allow various scaling preferences
    \item anybody willing to add support for color gradients?
    \item implement command options to \verb|\setbgimg| to support partially transparent background
  \end{itemize}

\lastpage

\subsection* {Design considerations:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item background preferences are ``asynchronous'', in the sense that they can imply rendering modifications
          in a part of the page that has already been displayed; this is why we first scan a page, looking for
          background specials (example, a red background), and only after we render it (setting the background to red
          before everything else). By the way, this mechanism was already in place for
          handling PostScript headers, that also appear asynchronously.
    \item is it worthwhile to consider the possibility of making a ``synchronous'' variant? This would allow
          for example to change the background color after a pause. But at what price?
  \end{itemize}
