PREREQUISITES
=============

You need Objective Caml 3.02 or higher to compile the sources.

However, you need a strictly higher version of Graphics (you can pick the
one under CVS of a more recent release), especially if you are using Advi
as your WhizzyTeX previewer. Otherwise, it should work but you will not
obtain a correct handling of signals (USR1 is used to tell Advi to reload).

You also need the `kpsewhich' utility of the `kpathsea' library
provided by many TeX distributions.

For the encapsulated postscript file inclusion, you require the
camlimages library, available at 
	http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlimages/

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION
============================

1. Configure using
   "./configure" (then edit the Makefile if necessary)

2. Compile with "make". It creates a binary file "advi".
   If your platform supports native compilation, you can also do
   "make opt", which creates a (faster) binary "advi.opt"
   (this is highly recommended).

3. Install the files by running make install.
   Alternatively:
   * Install the binary(ies) by hand, by simply copying it (them) to the
   appropriate directory.
   * Copy the files advi.sty to a place where it is a visible latex package.
   (kpewhich advi.sty should succeed from where LaTeX is run)
   * Copy the file advi.pro to a place where is it a visible PS header.
   (kpewhich advi.pro should succeed from where advi is run)
