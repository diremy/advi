PREREQUISITES
=============

You need Objective Caml 3.02 or higher to compile the sources.

However, you need a strickly higher version of Graphics (you can pick the
one under CVS a more recent release), especially if you are using Advi
as your WhizzyTeX previewer.  Otherwise, it should work but you will not
obtain a correct handling of signals (USR1 is used to tell Advi to reload).

You also need the `kpsewhich' utility of the `kpathsea' library
provided by many TeX distributions.

For the encapsulated postscript file inclusion, you require
camlimages library, found at 
	http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlimages/

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION
============================

"./configure", then edit the Makefile if necessary, 
and compile with "make". It creates a binary file "advi".

If your platform supports native compilation, you can also do
"make opt", which creates a (faster) binary "advi.opt"
(this is highly recommended).

Install the binary(ies) by hand, by simply copying it (them) to the
appropriate directories.

Copy the files advi.sty to a place where it is a visible latex package.
(kpewhich advi.pro should succeed from when LaTeX is run)

Copy the file advi.pro to a place where is it a visible PS header.
(kpewhich advi.pro should succeed from when advi is run)
