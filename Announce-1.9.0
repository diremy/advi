                       Active-DVI


Active-DVI is a programmable presenter and previewer for texts or slides
written in LaTeX. 

Version 1.9.0 is now available. 
It is mainly an update of the 1.8.0 version of Active-DVI with only few
improvements: 

   * Better configuration script.

   * Source files may be compressed with gzip or bzip2.

   * The default rendering of Encapsulated PS images is with GS,
     instead of camlimages, which is usually faster.

The Active-DVI previewer features in addition to regular DVI previewers:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion
     (using the graphics LaTeX package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

   * Embedded applications

   * Support for backpointing to the source file.

   * Support for PStricks, PGF, and beamer.

   * Support for WhizzyTeX

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of the various talks in
the directory ``examples''.
