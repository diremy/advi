Version 1.5+2
2003/10/03
        Long time standing bug of set_title has been fixed: the
        Active-DVI window is now allocated by the Window Manager with
        the expected correct name.

Version 1.5
2003/09/30:
        Introducing page timing dump to designated files for
        synchronisation purposes.

Version 1.4
2003/09/12:
	Extensively modified gr_reposition in grY11.c to
	correctly handle full screen operation.
	This was done by incorporating most of the logic
	found in the excellent mplayer project.

	Seems to work on most Window Managers.
	   KDE 3.1: OK
	   Sawfish: OK
	   Fluxbox: OK
	   MWM: NO (decorations are not removed)
	   Fvwm95: Partial (control bar is still on front) [can be removed by
	   WithDrawing and replacing the window, but this causes problems with
	   fvwm (no 95)]
	   Fvwm: Partial (virtual screen window still on front)
	   Twm: OK
