2003/09/12:
	Extensively modified gr_reposition in grY11.c to
	correctly handle full screen operation.
	This was done by incorporating most of the logic
	found in the excellent mplayer project.

	Seems to work on most Window Managers.
	   KDE 3.1: OK
	   Sawfish: OK
	   Fluxbox: OK
	   MWM: NO (decorations are not removed)
	   Fvwm95: Partial (control bar is still on front)
	   Fvwm: Partial (virtual screen window still on front)
	   Twm: OK
