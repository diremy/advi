<DT><STRONG>How to get a full-screen presentation ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just launch Active-DVI and type <CODE>^F</CODE>
(control-F) in the Active-DVI window.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to revert from full-screen to normal size ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just type <CODE>^F</CODE> (control-F) again in the
Active-DVI window!</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to center the slide when full-screen mode is active ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just use the mouse to move the bounding box of the
slide: pressing control key and the left button draws the bounding box, then
if you continue pressing the key and button you can drag the bounding
box where you want to.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to get online help for Active-DVI keys ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just press <CODE>?</CODE> in the Active-DVI window.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to get examples of talks ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Look in the distribution, sub-directory
<CODE>examples</CODE>. The sub-directories are
<CODE>basics</CODE> (from simple to moderately advanced style effects)
<CODE>prosper</CODE> (two presentations in directories <CODE>LL</CODE>,
and <CODE>Join</CODE>), and <CODE>seminar</CODE> (one example).
You may also consider the sub-directory
<CODE>test</CODE> of the source main directory and look at the
various <CODE>*.tex</CODE> files. Just type<CODE>make</CODE> in any of those
sub-directories to build the corresponding DVI presentations.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to ensure safety, since unknown applications can be launched
from the DVI file that I am previewing ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Active-DVI's  default behavior is not to automatically
launch embedded applications: when a presentation attempt to launch an
application, the presentation is stopped and a dialog box appear to
tell you the name of the application and ask you for confirmation
before launching.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How do I know in advance the set of applications that a
DVI file can launch ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just launch Active-DVI with the <CODE>-n</CODE> option.
<CODE>advi -n file.dvi</CODE> will analyse the file <CODE>file.dvi</CODE>
and print out the list of embedded commands it contains.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to print my slides for real on paper or slides for
a retro-projector ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Easy. Just use the <CODE>ignore</CODE> option of the
<CODE>advi.sty</CODE> package, it is especially devoted to that task!
Write <CODE>usepackage[ignore]{advi}</CODE> in the header of the document,
then use LaTeX to recompile your source file: the Active-DVI package
will suppress the effects that cannot be rendered and render the effects that
it knows how to emulate via postscript.</I>
 <DD>Additional answer: <I>Impossible. How could you ever believe that
somebody or something could render on a mere sheet of paper all those
text dancing movements and those fancy, fascinating, and creative
effects that your presentation features ? No hope: you really need
Active-DVI to play your talk!</I>
 <DD>Additional<SUP>2</SUP> (preventive) answer: <I>The additional
answer which immediately precedes this one is a joke; in fact, the
truth is: we worked hard such that the <CODE>ignore</CODE> option of
<CODE>advi.sty</CODE> does a good job; however, it is clear that the
Active-DVI style can just do its best to perform a task that
cannot be done perfectly.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How do I write on my slide during the presentation ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just type <CODE>s</CODE> to write text and
<CODE>S</CODE> to draw lines.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to write on my slides some programs that have colored
parts ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>Just use the environment <CODE>alltt</CODE>; then colors
(and other text annotations and typographic indications) are available
within a type-writter font setting. For instance:</I>
<PRE>
\begin{alltt}
{\it{(* Remark that double semi-colon is mandatory here. *)}}
let x = 1\textcolor{red}{;;}
let r = \{foo = 1; bar = "toto"\};;
\textcolor[named]{Red}{let} z = r.foo;;
\end{alltt}
</PRE>

Renders (much better than the following :)
<PRE>
<I>(* Remark that double semi-colon is mandatory here. *)</I>
let x = 1<FONT COLOR=red>;;</FONT>
let r = {foo = 1; bar = "toto"};;
<FONT COLOR=red>let</FONT> z = r.foo;;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG>How to write on my slides programs which have mathematical
formulas in them ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I>If you need mathematical formulas into your programs,
use the environment <CODE>alltt</CODE> and insert the formulas into fancy
parens <CODE>\(</CODE> and <CODE>\)</CODE>.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to visualize Adobe PostScript fonts like
<CODE>ptmr8t</CODE> using Active-DVI ?</STRONG>

 <DD>Answer: <I>You cannot! Active-DVI can display only PK based fonts
whose sources are provided in <CODE>.mf</CODE> files. Adobe fonts
having no <CODE>.mf</CODE> source files, hence METAFONT cannot create
the corresponding <CODE>.pk</CODE> files for Active-DVI.</I>
 <DD><I>The workaround is to use an equivalent of the problematic font
in the Computer-Modern font set, that has been designed by Donald Knuth
to be the default fonts for TeX.</I>

<DT><STRONG>How to solve the margin problems of Active-DVI (margins
are wrong with <CODE>advi</CODE> while <CODE>xdvi</CODE> works
perfect) ?</STRONG>
 <DD>Answer: <I><CODE>xdvi</CODE> and <CODE>advi</CODE> do not use the
same margins. <CODE>Advi</CODE> uses the specification that TeX emits
into the DVI file (bounding box) and does not add extra space for
margins. Unfortunately, many LaTeX styles and packages do not give a
relevant value to the bounding box. 
 <DD>The workaround is to modify margins, either by moving the
bounding-box around with the mouse (Control+button), or to use the
relevant option on the command line when launching <CODE>advi</CODE>
(the <CODE>-vmargin</CODE> and <CODE>-hmargin</CODE> options).</I>
