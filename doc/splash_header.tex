{\ActiveDVI} recognizes the keystrokes listed below when typed in its window.
Some keystrokes may optionally be preceded by a number, called \arg
below, whose interpretation is keystroke dependant. If \arg is unset,
its value is 1, unless specified otherwise.

{\ActiveDVI} maintains an history of previously visited pages
organized as a stack.
Additionnally, the history contains marked pages which are stronger than
unmarked pages.
