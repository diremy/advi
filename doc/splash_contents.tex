Advi recognizes the keystrokes listed below when typed in its window.
Some keystrokes may optionally be preceded by a number, called \arg below, whose
interpretation is keystroke dependant. If \arg is unset, its value is
1, unless specified otherwise.

Advi maintains an history of previously visited pages organized as a stack. 
Additionnally, the history contains marked pages which are stronger than
unmarked pages.
